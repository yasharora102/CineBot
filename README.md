# Cinebot - Python Telegram Bot for Movie Watchlist
Cinebot is a Python-based Telegram bot that allows users to create and manage their movie watchlist. The bot allows users to add movie titles, release years, and IMDb ratings to their watchlist by making API calls to the Open Movie Database (OMDb).

## Installation
To use Cinebot, you will need to obtain an API key from OMDb and configure it in the bot's source code. You will also need to install the PyTelegramBotAPI library in your Python environment. Also you will need to get a bot token from BotFather and configure it in the source code.

## Usage
To use Cinebot, simply run the script and start chatting with the bot on Telegram. The bot will respond to the following commands:
- `/start` - Start the bot
- `/movie <movie_name>` - Add a movie to your watchlist
- `/export` - Export your watchlist to a CSV file
- `/help` - Display help message
- `/stop` - Stop the bot
